# CodingChallenge2

Objective: This exercise will test your knowledge of conditionals and logic by creating a feature in a theoretical app that provides recommendations based on user ratings and reviews.


Step 1: Copy Over Coding Challenge Solution 1 solution to a new swift file in a separate repository named "Coding Challenge Solution 2".


Step 2: Implement New Feature Recommendation System
- Create a new variable recommendation (String) to store the recommendation message.
Using conditional statements, determine the recommendation based on the userRating:
- If the rating is 4.5 or higher, set recommendation to "Highly Recommended".
- If the rating is between 3.5 and 4.4, set recommendation to "Recommended".
- If the rating is between 2.5 and 3.4, set recommendation to "Moderately Recommended".
- If the rating is lower than 2.5, set recommendation to "Not Recommended".
- Print the recommendation.
